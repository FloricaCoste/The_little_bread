Once upon a time, in a land far, far away where magic still existed, a little girl call Sophia use to walk on forest in every single morning. In one day, she decides to make a trip around the world. 
 
Anywhere in discovery land she was not far away from green grass, stone walls, and twisty country roads. The magical castle which reach the blue sky and ruins that carry on their shoulder a bit of history send the little girl to see the most beautiful beach and the highest sea cliffs in Europe
