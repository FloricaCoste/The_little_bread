Once upon a time, in a land far, far away where magic still existed, a little girl call Sophia use to walk on forest in every single morning. In one day, she decides to make a trip around the world. 
 
Anywhere in discovery land she was not far away from green grass, stone walls, and twisty country roads. The magical castle which reach the blue sky and ruins that carry on their shoulder a bit of history send the little girl to see the most beautiful beach and the highest sea cliffs in Europe 
On her journey, she didnâ€™t miss Kylemore Abbey castle. The castle was originally built as a private home by Mitchell Henry as a gift to his wife, whom later tragically died at a reasonably young age. Henry never remarried and built a small cathedral on the castle grounds in her loving memory. Today Kylemore Abbey is owned and run by the Benedictine community who have been in residence here since 1920
