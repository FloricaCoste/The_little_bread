<h1>The old story of dry Bread </h1>

<H2>POSMAGI</H2>

<p>
Once upon a time it was in a village a man so lazy; that even to chew a dry bread he found as being very hard . Villagers are seeing that this man does not make any effort to work. The people from the village decide to send him on the trip around the world not to give others an example of laziness.
And so, they choose two people from the village and go to the house to give him the news
</p>
<p>
That was then.
</p>

<p>
On the way to meet him with a carriage that was a lady. Lady, seeing the man show being ill, asked with pity on the two peasants, saying:
</p>

<p>
- Folks! It seems that man in car is sick, or poor, and it looks like he's going to somewhere to look for....
</p>

<p>
- No, ma'am, 'said one of the villagers; forgive honest to your own, but it can learn a lazy do not believe to be having interest in the world, and get send him on the trip around the world, to cleanse the village of a loafer.
</p>
<p>
- Hohhot...!, lady said; Poor man, he is going to die as a dog, poor him! You better take it to land on me.
</p>
<p>
- I have a barn full of "POSMAGI(small little bread - dry)" there, it is just too difficult circumstances, God forbid!
</p>
<p>
He can eat "POSMAGI", he will be leaving near my house and we can to help each other.
</p>
<P>
... Well he said, who said that "the country oxen and horses eat". Let's give the lady answered.
</p>
<p>
- But ... are the "PORMAGI" soft? the lazy man asked the lady
</p>
<p>
- What did he say? lady asked the villagers.
</p>
<p>
- What to say, gracious lady, pick one. He asks that are the "PORMAGI" soft?
</p>
<p>
- O MY GOD!!!! The lady said with wonder, still I heard that! Yes he can ...?
</p>
<p>
- Hey, man sluggard: for soft bread you have to work, Do you want or not?
</p>
<p>
- Yes, he replied lazy. Pull better all before! How much care for that empty mouth!
</p>
<p>
When one of the villagers said the lady:
</p>
<p>
- Your Goodness, gracious lady, ... You can see that it not only take us to the gallows so, cuckoo flower, take his habit. How even? An entire village would not put it hand to hand so he could make out some island? But you could help! Only laziness ..., what do you bother!
</p>
<p>
The lady then, with all the goodwill that she had ,and charity and all, saying:
</p>
<p>
- Folks, do what you have to do, God will reveal!
</p>
<p>
And the lazy villagers go to the right place and get them the way.
