        3 cups tepid water.

    <h2>How to Make Bread:</h2>

    <h4>Assemble your ingredients.</h4>
    <p> In a small bowl, mix your yeast with about a 1/4 cup of warm water.
        If the water is too warm, the yeast will be killed, if it's too cool, it won't activate enough to make the bread rise properly. It should be warm enough you could keep your finger in it without becoming uncomfortable.
        After a minute or two, the mixture should start to take on a thicker, frothy texture, and should smell a lot like a beer.
        If it's bubbly and thick, the yeast is activated properly and ready to go.
   </p>
    <h4>
        Mix the flour and salt together thoroughly in a large mixing bowl.
    </h4>
    <p>
        The bowl needs to be big enough to hold all your flour and water together at once and mix it comfortably.
        When you've mixed the dry ingredients, you can also add the yeast, whether your bubbly activated wet mixture. ' ||
        Stir it into the flour. Alternatively, you can mix the dough in an electric mixer. Mixing the dough, however, is only a short part of making a loaf of bread,
        so it's usually easier to just mix it up by hand. It's not necessary to use a mixer, especially because you'll need to get your hands dirty anyway!
    </p>
    <h4>
        Add the water, mixing thoroughly.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Slowly add water to the bowl with one hand, while you stir the flour with the wooden spoon in your other hand.
      You're looking to form the initial dough and get all the ingredients to come together.' ||
      It's important to keep your spoon moving. ' ||
      The amount of water you'll need to make the dough can be quite variable (about 3 cups of water) but you'll get it with some practice. Add slowly and stir, watching the dough come together.
      As soon as the bread starts coming together in the bowl, you should stop adding water.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Turn the dough out on a well-floured kneading surface
    </h4>
    <p>
        Let the dough rest for at least five minutes.
        At this stage, the gluten strands are starting to form, giving the bread its wonderfully chewy texture.

        The initial kneading is the most important step in preparing the dough. You want to firmly knead constantly for at least 5-10 minutes, or until the dough feels smooth.
        The surface of the dough should be soft and look mostly uniform.
        If it looks like the craggy surface of the moon, keep kneading, adding flour as necessary.
        It takes some practice to get the motion right.
        Make sure your hands are well-floured, and that the dough isn't sticking to the surface by keeping a light dusting of flour on both.
    </p>
    <h4>Let the dough rise for about 3 hours</h4>
    <p>
        Put the dough back into the bowl after cleaning it out thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap, or a towel.
        Keep the dough in a warm, but not hot, place. The ideal temperature is about 20-25 degrees C for dough to rise.
    </p>

    <h2>Form the dough into whatever shape you choose</h2>
    <p>
        Remove the dough from the bowl and cut it into however many distinct loaves, batards, or baguettes you want to bake, then start rolling it out.
    </p>
    <h4>To form boules</h4>
    <p>
      Cut the dough in half and reform into two simple rounded lumps like you've been forming. ' ||
    Place them onto a sheet sprinkled with a small amount of cornmeal and cover.
    </p>
    <h4>To form baguettes</h4>
    <p>
      Put the dough into 4 equal portions and roll them out on a floured surface, long and skinny.
      It'll take several rollings to get them worked out long enough, so keep moving from the center of the loaf outward,' ||
       ' rolling them as evenly as possible.'
       </p>
    <h4>To form batards</h4>
    <p>
      Cut the dough into 4 or 6 portions and roll shorter, squatter baguettes.
      </p>
      <h2> Bake at 180 degrees C for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</h2>
